//just task rem: getRecipe fxn update like getRecipefromgemini
and rest of things are good 
learner:
The error Cannot read properties of null (reading 'scrollIntoView') occurs because recipeSection.current is null when scrollIntoView is called. This can happen if the ref is not properly attached to the DOM element or if the element is not rendered when the effect runs.

To fix this, ensure that the ref is correctly attached and the element is rendered before calling scrollIntoView.

App.jsx
Update the useEffect to check if recipeSection.current is not null before calling scrollIntoView.

The line const trimmedRecipeText = recipeText.split('\n').slice(0, 5).join('\n'); performs the following operations:

recipeText.split('\n'): This splits the recipeText string into an array of lines using the newline character (\n) as the delimiter.
.slice(0, 5): This takes the first 5 elements (lines) from the array.
.join('\n'): This joins the first 5 lines back into a single string, with each line separated by a newline character (\n).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
In summary, this line of code extracts the first 5 lines from the recipeText and combines them back into a single string.
